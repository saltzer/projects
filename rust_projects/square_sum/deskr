Complete the square sum function so that it 
squares each number passed into it and then 
sums the results together.

For example, for [1, 2, 2] it should return 9 
because 1^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 = 9.


let mut squared_sum: i32 = 0;
    for num in vec {
        squared_sum += num*num;
    }
    squared_sum

fn square_sum(vec: Vec<i32>) -> i32 {
