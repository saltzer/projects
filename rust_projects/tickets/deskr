The new "Avengers" movie has just been released! 
There are a lot of people at the cinema box office 
standing in a huge line. Each of them has a 
single 100, 50 or 25 dollar bill. An "Avengers" 
ticket costs 25 dollars.

Vasya is currently working as a clerk. He wants to 
sell a ticket to every single person in this line.

Can Vasya sell a ticket to every person and give 
change if he initially has no money and sells the 
tickets strictly in the order people queue?

Return YES, if Vasya can sell a ticket to every 
person and give change with the bills he has at hand
at that moment. Otherwise return NO.

        for cash in people:

            if cash == 50:

                change.append(50)
